## Introduction

**Computer Vision** is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to "see" and make sense of visual data. It involves various tasks like recognizing objects, analyzing images, and extracting useful information from visual inputs. Applications of computer vision include:
- **Image Classification** (e.g., identifying objects in images)
- **Object Detection** (e.g., detecting faces, cars, or other objects in images)
- **Image Segmentation** (e.g., dividing an image into different regions)
- **Face Recognition** (e.g., identifying individuals based on facial features)

## Key Concepts

1. **Image Processing**: Techniques like image filtering, edge detection, and transformation (resizing, rotating, etc.) used to manipulate or analyze images.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: A deep learning architecture specifically designed for image data. CNNs are widely used for image classification and object detection.
3. **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects within an image. Common methods include **YOLO** (You Only Look Once), **SSD** (Single Shot Multibox Detector), and **Faster R-CNN**.
4. **Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into multiple segments (regions), typically to isolate objects or boundaries.
5. **Feature Extraction**: The process of detecting specific patterns or features in images, such as edges, corners, or textures.

## Computer Vision Tasks

1. **Image Classification**:
   In image classification, the model assigns a label to an entire image. CNNs are typically used for this task.

2. **Object Detection**:
   Object detection goes beyond classification by identifying the location of multiple objects within an image. Models such as YOLO and SSD are widely used for real-time object detection.

3. **Image Segmentation**:
   Image segmentation involves dividing an image into distinct regions or segments. Segmentation can be **semantic** (where similar objects are labeled with the same category) or **instance-based** (where each object instance is labeled separately).

4. **Facial Recognition**:
   This task involves identifying or verifying a personâ€™s identity based on their facial features.

5. **Pose Estimation**:
   Pose estimation identifies the configuration of the human body (e.g., keypoints for joints) in an image or video.
